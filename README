Homework 3 - CLI-IMAGE EDITOR

What I've learned from this homework:
- how to use strings, structs, ascii and binary files
- how to edit an image, which was enjoyable
- how to use header files
- more about .ppm and .pgm files

First of all, the problem starts with reading an action. After this,
each action will be solved. Also, I used c files and headers with
suggestive names.(load_image.c has 3 functions, aloc_matrix and free_matrix,
which are used in other files, same for save_image.c with save_coordinates)
Each function is explained in the program.

I will explain each action now:

1. LOAD:
- check if the image was loaded or not
- if the image wasn't loaded, it will load a ppm
or pgm file
- verifies what type of image needs to be loaded, if it's binary or ascii,
if it's grayscale or colour
- I used the function called load_image

2. SELECT:
- if stdin reads the word ALL, the coordinates are 0, 0, width
and height
- if stdin reads 4 strings, the program will check if they are
numbers will swap values if it is needed
- also checks if the numbers are less than 0,
or are bigger than the given width/height
- the function that I used is called select_image +
helpful functions swap_values, check is_number

3. ROTATE:
- comes with the angle that the image or a part of the image
will be rotated
- the angle can be +/-90, +/-180, +/-270, +/-360
- I used 6 functions: rotate_image, rotate_90_degrees
rotate_full_image_gray, rotates_full_image_color, rotate_gray,
rotate_color

4. CROP:
- crops the photo with the selection made earlier
- the used function check the type of the file,
allocates a new_matrix with the made selection,
then frees the old one, and changes with the new one

5. APPLY:
- four filters: EDGE, SHARPEN, BLUR, GAUSSIAN_BLUR
- the filters are used for colourful photos
- if the image is grayscale a message will be displayed:
"Easy, Charlie Chaplin!"
- if the filter is not one of those 4, a message will be displayed:
"APPlY parameter invalid"
- uses the kernels image
- functions used are apply_filter, apply_image, and
clamp_function

6. SAVE:
- saves the image with the name from stdin
- if ascii is read from stdin, the file is ascii,
then it is binary
- used function is called save_image

7. EXIT:
- frees the matrixes that are used
- used function called exit_image

If an image is not loaded, the operation will not take place
and a message will be displayed
After every successful operation, the output will display
a suggestive message
